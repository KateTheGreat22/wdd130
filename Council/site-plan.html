      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Council was founded in September 2024 in an effort to connect people from a wide variety of academic disciplines & to spread knowledge, skills, and sarcastic comments. The Council has since been called upon several times to support the people in their college community with advice and/or food. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>In order to streamline these weekly meetings and make this group more accessible to the populace, The Council website will provide essential information about the nature of these meetings and the times available to meet different group members. It will also provide quotes of the day, college advice, and funny dating stories, including the Goblet of Desire. The Council website will serve to inspire and provide a source of joy to not only the group members but hopefully their community as a whole.
