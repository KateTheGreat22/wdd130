                    There was a time when a man had to sit and watch bears
                    attacking his family while standing
                    in the pouring rain. While Rafting for Fun & Pleasure 
                    might not be able to keep your family away from bear attacks,
                    we can ensure that you won't see the 
                    carnage while getting soaked. We have tents!

                    Did you think that we only had slow water??? 
                    Look no farther than our fast moving water!
                    Trust me. It's cooler than you think.

                    Do you ever wish that you were just standing in 
                    slow water staring at the world?
                    We did too! With Rafting for Fun & Pleasure, 
                    we ensure that all rivers and/or lakes are
                    sort of sanitary. Nothing says fun like 
                    getting fresh water diseases!
